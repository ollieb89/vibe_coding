# Corpus

## What This Is

Corpus is a local semantic search engine for AI agent libraries. It indexes agent skills, workflows, prompts, and code across configured directories and local repos, then makes them instantly queryable via CLI, MCP server, and Python API. Built for developers who maintain collections of agent skills and need to surface relevant files without grepping.

v1.0 ships as a CLI tool (`corpus add`, `corpus index`, `corpus search`, `corpus status`) backed by LanceDB with hybrid BM25+vector retrieval. An MCP server (`corpus mcp serve`) exposes search to Claude Code and other agents. A Python API (`from corpus import search`) enables programmatic access.

## Current Milestone: v1.1 Search Quality

**Goal:** Eliminate noise from search results by controlling which files get indexed and improving construct classification accuracy.

**Target features:**
- Configurable extension allowlist in `corpus.toml` — users control exactly which file types are indexed (no more `.sh`, `.html`, config files polluting results)
- Frontmatter-aware construct classifier — reads YAML frontmatter (`component_type`, tags) to accurately classify skills, workflows, agent configs
- Accurate `--construct` filtering — classification accuracy makes the existing filter flag actually useful

## Core Value

Surface relevant agent files instantly — query an entire local agent library and get ranked, relevant results in under a second.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ LanceDB embedding pipeline with deterministic chunk IDs — v1.0
- ✓ Source config via `corpus.toml` (CONF-01–CONF-04) — v1.0
- ✓ `corpus add <dir>` CLI command (CONF-05) — v1.0
- ✓ `corpus index` with incremental re-indexing and ghost document removal (INGEST-01–INGEST-07) — v1.0
- ✓ Structure-aware chunking: heading-based (`.md`), AST-based (`.py`), line-based fallback — v1.0
- ✓ `corpus search` with hybrid BM25+vector+RRF ranking (SEARCH-01, SEARCH-02) — v1.0
- ✓ Search filters: `--source`, `--type`, `--construct`, `--limit` (SEARCH-03, SEARCH-04, SEARCH-05) — v1.0
- ✓ Agent construct classifier: skill/prompt/workflow/agent_config/code/documentation (CLASS-01–CLASS-03) — v1.0
- ✓ AI summarizer per indexed file with Ollama, config-gated (SUMM-01–SUMM-03) — v1.0
- ✓ `corpus status` with file count, chunk count, last indexed, model (CLI-04) — v1.0
- ✓ FastMCP server with pre-warmed embeddings, `corpus_search` tool (MCP-01–MCP-06) — v1.0
- ✓ Python API: `search()`, `index()`, `SearchResult` dataclass (API-01–API-03) — v1.0
- ✓ Safety: no CLI KeyErrors, no silent exception swallowing, MCP `content_error` signaling — v1.0

### Active

<!-- v1.1 Search Quality -->

- [ ] Configurable extension allowlist in corpus.toml (CONF-06)
- [ ] Frontmatter-aware construct classifier (CLASS-04, CLASS-05)
- [ ] Accurate --construct filter results via improved classification (SEARCH-06)

### Out of Scope

- Hosted/cloud index — local-only (privacy, simplicity)
- Real-time file watching — manual index refresh only; daemon complexity not justified yet
- Web UI — CLI + MCP sufficient for target users
- LLM rewriting (corpus-analyzer original feature) — retained but not the focus
- Chunk-level results (CHUNK-01–CHUNK-03) — v2 candidate
- TypeScript/JS AST chunking (IDX-01) — v2 candidate

## Context

**v1.0 shipped 2026-02-23.**

- ~6,100 lines Python source
- Tech stack: LanceDB, FastMCP, Pydantic, Typer, Rich, OllamaEmbedder (nomic-embed-text)
- 164 tests passing (pytest)
- XDG Base Directory compliant: config in `~/.config/corpus/`, data in `~/.local/share/corpus/`
- Single-user local tool; no daemon, no cloud dependency

Known limitations heading into v2 planning:
- Search returns file-level results; chunk-level line ranges would improve precision
- TypeScript/JS files use line-based chunking (no AST awareness)
- Cold-start on first index after KEEP_ALIVE expiry still possible (pre-warm only covers MCP startup)

## Constraints

- **Runtime**: Python 3.12, managed with `uv`
- **Package manager**: `uv` only (no pip/poetry)
- **Embeddings**: Must support offline (Ollama) — cloud providers optional
- **Storage**: LanceDB for vector+metadata; FTS via tantivy (built into LanceDB)
- **Existing tests**: Test suite must stay green

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Pivot corpus-analyzer rather than start fresh | Extraction, models, DB, CLI already built | ✓ Good — saved ~2 phases of setup work |
| LanceDB over sqlite-vec | Embedded, ships hybrid search + BM25 + RRF natively | ✓ Good — no external service, fast queries |
| Hybrid search (vector + BM25 via RRF) | Better recall than pure vector; handles exact name matches | ✓ Good — validated in UAT |
| Protocol-based embedding abstraction | Offline-first (Ollama) with optional cloud providers | ✓ Good — clean swap if needed |
| Store embedding model name in schema | Cannot be retrofitted after first embed | ✓ Good — enforced at query time |
| AST-aware chunking for `.py`, heading-based for `.md` | Better chunk coherence vs line-based | ✓ Good — search quality improved |
| Rule-based classifier first, LLM fallback | Cost-conscious; LLM gate via `use_llm_classification` | ✓ Good — zero LLM cost by default |
| Default `use_llm_classification = False` | Avoid unexpected Ollama API costs | ✓ Good — explicit opt-in |
| `needs_reindex()` removed entirely | Hash-based change detection makes it redundant | ✓ Good — dead code eliminated |
| FTS rebuild only in `index_source()` | Redundant rebuild in `CorpusSearch.__init__` was wasteful | ✓ Good — ~20% faster search init |
| MCP `content_error` field vs exception | Avoids breaking existing clients; explicit error signal | ✓ Good — graceful degradation |
| Path constants in `config/schema.py` | Avoid circular imports from dual definitions | ✓ Good — single source of truth |
