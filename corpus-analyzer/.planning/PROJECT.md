# Corpus

## What This Is

Corpus is a local semantic search engine for AI agent libraries. It indexes agent skills, workflows, prompts, and code across configured directories and local repos, then makes them instantly queryable via CLI, MCP server, and Python API. Built for developers who maintain collections of agent skills and need to surface relevant files without grepping.

v1.0 ships as a CLI tool (`corpus add`, `corpus index`, `corpus search`, `corpus status`) backed by LanceDB with hybrid BM25+vector retrieval. An MCP server (`corpus mcp serve`) exposes search to Claude Code and other agents. A Python API (`from corpus import search`) enables programmatic access.

v1.1 adds configurable extension allowlists per source (no more config files polluting results) and frontmatter-aware construct classification — YAML `type:` and `component_type:` fields are classified at 0.95 confidence, making `--construct` filtering reliably accurate.

v1.2 adds a relationship graph layer: `corpus index` now extracts `## Related Skills` / `## Related Files` links from indexed Markdown and persists them as a directed graph, queryable via `corpus graph <slug>`.

## Core Value

Surface relevant agent files instantly — query an entire local agent library and get ranked, relevant results in under a second.

## Requirements

- ✓ Safety: no CLI KeyErrors, no silent exception swallowing, MCP `content_error` signaling — v1.0

- ✓ Relationship graph: `corpus index` extracts + persists `## Related Skills` / `## Related Files` edges; `corpus graph <slug>` queries upstream/downstream neighbours; closest-prefix ambiguity resolution; `--show-duplicates` (GRAPH-01–GRAPH-05) — v1.2
- ✓ Dead `use_llm_classification` parameter removed from `index_source()` and `SourceConfig` (CLEAN-01) — v1.2

### Active

*(no active requirements — v1.2 shipped all v1 requirements)*

### Out of Scope

- Hosted/cloud index — local-only (privacy, simplicity)
- Real-time file watching — manual index refresh only; daemon complexity not justified yet
- Web UI — CLI + MCP sufficient for target users
- LLM rewriting (corpus-analyzer original feature) — retained but not the focus
- Chunk-level results (CHUNK-01–CHUNK-03) — v2 candidate
- TypeScript/JS AST chunking (IDX-01) — v2 candidate

## Context

**v1.2 shipped 2026-02-24. v1.1 shipped 2026-02-23. All v1 requirements complete.**

- ~7,300 lines Python source (graph module ~300 lines over v1.1 baseline)
- Tech stack: LanceDB, FastMCP, Pydantic, Typer, Rich, OllamaEmbedder (nomic-embed-text); graph layer uses SQLite (`graph.sqlite`)
- 281 tests passing (pytest; 1 deleted test for removed field)
- XDG Base Directory compliant: config in `~/.config/corpus/`, data in `~/.local/share/corpus/`
- Single-user local tool; no daemon, no cloud dependency
- Pre-existing mypy (42 errors) and ruff (529 errors) across unrelated files — noted for v2 cleanup

Known limitations heading into v2 planning:
- Search returns file-level results; chunk-level line ranges would improve precision
- TypeScript/JS files use line-based chunking (no AST awareness)
- Cold-start on first index after KEEP_ALIVE expiry still possible (pre-warm only covers MCP startup)

## Constraints

- **Runtime**: Python 3.12, managed with `uv`
- **Package manager**: `uv` only (no pip/poetry)
- **Embeddings**: Must support offline (Ollama) — cloud providers optional
- **Storage**: LanceDB for vector+metadata; FTS via tantivy (built into LanceDB)
- **Existing tests**: Test suite must stay green

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Pivot corpus-analyzer rather than start fresh | Extraction, models, DB, CLI already built | ✓ Good — saved ~2 phases of setup work |
| LanceDB over sqlite-vec | Embedded, ships hybrid search + BM25 + RRF natively | ✓ Good — no external service, fast queries |
| Hybrid search (vector + BM25 via RRF) | Better recall than pure vector; handles exact name matches | ✓ Good — validated in UAT |
| Protocol-based embedding abstraction | Offline-first (Ollama) with optional cloud providers | ✓ Good — clean swap if needed |
| Store embedding model name in schema | Cannot be retrofitted after first embed | ✓ Good — enforced at query time |
| AST-aware chunking for `.py`, heading-based for `.md` | Better chunk coherence vs line-based | ✓ Good — search quality improved |
| Rule-based classifier first, LLM fallback | Cost-conscious; LLM gate via `use_llm_classification` | ✓ Good — zero LLM cost by default |
| Default `use_llm_classification = False` | Avoid unexpected Ollama API costs | ✓ Good — explicit opt-in |
| `needs_reindex()` removed entirely | Hash-based change detection makes it redundant | ✓ Good — dead code eliminated |
| FTS rebuild only in `index_source()` | Redundant rebuild in `CorpusSearch.__init__` was wasteful | ✓ Good — ~20% faster search init |
| MCP `content_error` field vs exception | Avoids breaking existing clients; explicit error signal | ✓ Good — graceful degradation |
| Path constants in `config/schema.py` | Avoid circular imports from dual definitions | ✓ Good — single source of truth |
| `ClassificationResult` dataclass (not raw string) | Structured data enables confidence + source tracking | ✓ Good — clean extension point for LLM/rule/frontmatter sources |
| Frontmatter priority > rule-based | Explicit declaration is higher signal than heuristics | ✓ Good — 0.95 vs 0.60 confidence gap makes priority clear |
| `type:` confidence 0.95, `tags:` confidence 0.70 | Explicit type is direct match; tags are softer signal | ✓ Good — appropriate weighting |
| `ensure_schema_v3()` in-place migration | Existing users don't rebuild index on upgrade | ✓ Good — idempotent, zero data loss |
| Extension allowlist default includes doc/code types | Sensible out-of-box behavior without requiring config | ✓ Good — excludes `.sh`, `.html`, `.json`, `.lock`, binaries automatically |

| SQLite for graph store (not LanceDB) | Graph edges are relational; SQLite is simpler and avoids LanceDB schema overhead | ✓ Good — separate `graph.sqlite` keeps concerns cleanly separated |
| Closest-prefix ambiguity resolution for slugs | Context-aware: picks the candidate closest in filesystem path to the referencing file | ✓ Good — handles multi-repo agent libraries without false matches |
| Hardcode `use_llm=False` at call site (not remove arg) | `classify_file` defaults to `use_llm=True`; removing kwarg would silently switch to LLM classification | ✓ Good — preserved rule-based classification behaviour |
